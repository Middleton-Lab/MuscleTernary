Description: This package is designed for visualizing 3D muscle
    vectors in ternary space. Functions are available to read in origin and
    insertion data from files, with force or moment data and an arbitrary
    number of categorical or continuous variables. Plotting is
    accomplished via extensions of the ggtern package.
