# Installation

## Preliminaries

- Install `remotes` (if you haven't already): `install.packages("remotes")`

You might also need to install Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) if the installation step below does not work correctly.

## For initial installation or updates

- Install MuscleTernary from github:
	- `remotes::install_github(dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)`

View `?MuscleTernary` or `demo(ternary_plot)` for a demo.
